## Notes for the presentation, YT!

### "funny" introduction

1. Welcome to the world of game of thrones; where the characters are plentiful and complicated, and the shock value is more for show than for actual character development. If season 8 has taught us anything, it is that for the show to be any good, we have to write it ourselves. To do so, it would help to have a good understanding of how the most important characters in the books interact with and relate to each other.
Apart from satisfying the redditor neckbeard nerds, this analysis can explore whether the social graph of fictive worlds is the same in the minds of the fans as it is in the original work.

### Size and origins of social graphs

2. This will be possible using two social graphs; one constructed using the ebook text from the five books and one constructed using posts on the r/asoiaf subreddit downloaded using PushShift.
The books take up 10 MB consisting of 658 chapters totalling about 2M words.
From reddit, we have collected 100MB data in NIGGAK submissions posted between the releases of season 7 and season 8 that give us a corpus of NIGGA words.
For both graphs, the 34 nodes correspond to characters.
In the book graph, we link them if two characters are mentioned in the same chapter giving us 505 links and on reddit, we do so if characters are mentioned in the same post which ends up up in 561 links.
The initial degree distributions show only a slight difference:
For the book graph the average degree is 30, while it is 33 in the Reddit graph.

### What do we do from here?
  
3. Now, we really want to know what the differences are in the character relations.
From where do the degree distribution difference come?
Are the communities the same in both graphs - and do these communities correspond to the factions in the story?
The opportunities for analysis using natural language processing are plentiful.
We want to use this to explain the causes of graph differences and visualize the character personalitites using word clouds and frequency diagrams.
